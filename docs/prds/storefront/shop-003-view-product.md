# SHOP-003: View product


## Outcome and scope

A shopper can inspect a product before purchase.

## Requirements

- Authorize each action against its resource and actor; reject invalid or stale operations without partial effects.
- Show relevant progress, confirmation, empty and failure states, including a clear next action.
- Use the service ownership and security boundaries in the shared contracts.

## Acceptance and verification

- The outcome is achieved for an eligible actor and unauthorized actors cannot access or change the resource.

- Verify integration with the owning service and its persisted state.
