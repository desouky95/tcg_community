## Outcome

An operator fulfills a paid NextPull order.

## Requirements

- Medusa records fulfillment and tracking when available; communicate the status to the customer.
- Authorize each action against its resource and actor; reject invalid or stale operations without partial effects.
- Show relevant progress, confirmation, empty and failure states, including a clear next action.
- Use the service ownership and security boundaries in the shared contracts.

## Acceptance and verification

- The outcome is achieved for an eligible actor and unauthorized actors cannot access or change the resource.
- Verify the main flow, validation and failure handling, including retries and concurrent changes where applicable.
- Verify integration with the owning service and its persisted state.
