# SWAP-011: Forward verified items


## Outcome and scope

NextPull forwards verified items to the opposite participants.

## Requirements

- Record separate outgoing shipments and tracking after both sides pass verification; each participant confirms receipt independently.
- Authorize each action against its resource and actor; reject invalid or stale operations without partial effects.
- Show relevant progress, confirmation, empty and failure states, including a clear next action.
- Apply the shared swap lifecycle and safety rules; retain an auditable history without exposing private evidence or contact details.

## Acceptance and verification

- The outcome is achieved for an eligible actor and unauthorized actors cannot access or change the resource.
- Verify the main flow, validation and failure handling, including retries and concurrent changes where applicable.
- Test each affected participant and operator permission, state transition, block and dispute path.
